			<h2>About The Pomodoro Technique</h2>
			<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'Pomodoros' (from the Italian word for 'tomatoes') separated by breaks.</blockquote >
